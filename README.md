# Sleepy Discord
C++ library for Discord

# Why?
Just for the novelty of using a C++ library for Discord.

#Will Updating the library break my bot?

Yes, and for now I don't plan on making 0.0 versions backwards compatable with 1.0 versions or later.

# Requirements
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)
* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
* [Websocket++](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp)
* [cpr](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr)
