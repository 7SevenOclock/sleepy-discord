# Getting Started

 1. In case you do not already have any source code, create a cpp file and copy and paste [this example code](https://github.com/yourWaifu/sleepy-discord/blob/master/examples/hello/example0.cpp).

 2. If you haven't already installed git, do so now. Type in the command ``git --version`` to make sure it's installed. You may also use a git gui if you like.

 3. Clone the git repository, ``https://github.com/yourWaifu/sleepy-discord.git``, to somewhere around your source code, preferably a [subdirectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)) with all your dependencies.

```shell
cd my-project-example
git clone https://github.com/yourWaifu/sleepy-discord.git
```
